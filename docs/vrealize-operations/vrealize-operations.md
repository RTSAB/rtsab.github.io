## VMware vRealize Operations
VMware vRealize Operations (vROps) is a cloud management platform that enables IT administrators to monitor and manage their virtual infrastructure, including VMware vSphere, Kubernetes, and Public Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments. vROps provides a unified view of the infrastructure and delivers insights into its performance, capacity, and health.

vROps uses advanced analytics and machine learning to provide actionable insights into the infrastructure, enabling IT teams to proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users. It can also help optimize resource utilization and reduce costs by identifying underutilized resources and recommending workload placement and optimization.
