# Cloud Native Computing Foundation

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is one of the projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. CNCF aims to accelerate the adoption of containers, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

CNCF hosts a multitude of projects, with more to be added in the future. CNCF provides resources to each of the projects, but, at the same time, each project continues to operate independently under its pre-existing governance structure and with its existing maintainers. Projects within CNCF are categorized based on achieved status: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated. At the time of this writing, a dozen projects had reached Graduated status with many more Incubating and in the Sandbox.
