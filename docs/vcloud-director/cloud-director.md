## VMware Cloud Director

VMware Cloud Director (VCD) is a cloud management platform designed to enable service providers and enterprise IT teams to deliver infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and other cloud-based services to their customers. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating and managing cloud resources, including virtual machines, networks, storage, and security.

VCD provides a multi-tenant, self-service environment where customers can deploy and manage their own virtual machines, networks, and storage resources, while IT administrators can monitor and manage the infrastructure behind the scenes. It provides an extensive set of APIs that enable integration with third-party systems and tools, making it a powerful platform for building and managing cloud-based services.
