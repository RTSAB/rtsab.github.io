# The Kubernetes Maturity Model
The Kubernetes Maturity Model is our way of trying to make sense of the journey into Cloud Native application on Kubernetes. It is not a hard and fast truth but should rather be seen as a guide and inspiration for organizations embarking on the Kubernetes journey. The inspiration for the model is drawn from the [Capability Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model) developed in 1986.

## **1. Culture and Organization:**
- **Level 1 - Awareness**: Limited awareness of Kubernetes within the organization. Individuals are trying out containers and container orchestration.
- **Level 2 - Learning and Experimentation**: Teams are learning and experimenting with Kubernetes.
- **Level 3 - Cross-Functional Teams**: Cross-functional teams collaborate effectively on Kubernetes projects. Roles and responsibilities are defined.
- **Level 4 - DevOps and SRE Culture**: DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices are embraced.
- **Level 5 - Cloud-Native Culture**: Cloud-native culture with a focus on automation, continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.
## **2. Architecture:**
- **Level 1 - Initial**: Kubernetes is used with basic configurations, and applications are monolithic with little or no containerization.
- **Level 2 - Basic Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is deployed with basic configurations, and some applications are containerized. Basic pod management and networking are in place.
- **Level 3 - Standardized Architecture**: Kubernetes is deployed with standardized architecture patterns, including the use of controllers like Deployments and Services.
- **Level 4 - Advanced Kubernetes**: Advanced architecture patterns like microservices and stateful services are implemented effectively.
- **Level 5 - Cloud-Native Excellence**: The architecture fully embraces cloud-native principles, utilizing advanced Kubernetes features and cloud-specific integrations.
## **3. Automation and CI/CD:**
- **Level 1 - Manual Deployment**: Manual deployment and limited automation.
- **Level 2 - Basic Automation**: Basic CI/CD pipelines for building and deploying containerized applications.
- **Level 3 - Full CI/CD Integration and Observability**: Full integration of CI/CD with Kubernetes, including automated testing and rollout strategies. Observability for proactive operations.
- **Level 4 - GitOps and Progressive Delivery**: Advanced GitOps practices and progressive delivery for continuous improvement.
- **Level 5 - Canary and Blue/Green Deployments**: Implement advanced deployment strategies like canary and blue/green deployments.
## **4. Security and Compliance:**
- **Level 1 - Basic Security**: Basic security measures in place, but minimal compliance checks.
- **Level 2 - Network Policies**: Network policies and RBAC are enforced for access control.
- **Level 3 - Security Scanning**: Implement container image scanning and security best practices.
- **Level 4 - Compliance as Code**: Compliance checks are automated as code in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Level 5 - Zero Trust and Beyond**: Implement zero trust networking, advanced security policies, and continuous compliance monitoring.
## **5. Scalability and Performance:**
- **Level 1 - Minimal Scaling**: Manual scaling with limited performance optimization.
- **Level 2 - Basic Scaling**: Basic autoscaling and some performance tuning.
- **Level 3 - Efficient Scaling**: Efficient resource utilization, autoscaling, and performance monitoring.
- **Level 4 - Cost-Optimized Scaling**: Cost optimization through resource efficiency and scaling strategies.
- **Level 5 - High-Performance Cloud-Native Apps**: High-performance, cloud-native applications with advanced scaling and optimization.ÃŸ
